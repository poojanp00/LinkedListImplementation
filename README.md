# Linked List Implementation

## General Overview

This project implements a PList class that imitates the functionality of Python listsâ€”but with different syntax. Using instances of the ObjectNode class as individual nodes in a list, a general list class (PList) is constructed with many of the same features found in Python lists.

## Usage

> javac ObjectNode.java 

> javac PList.java

> java PList
